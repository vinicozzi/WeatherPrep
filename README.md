WeatherPrep App
The WeatherPrep app allows users to input their city and get the daily weather forecast along with a recommendation on what to wear for the day. The app uses the Open Meteo Weather API to fetch the daily weather information, which includes the temperature and the temperature that it will feel like. The app then sources this information through the OpenAI API to get a response on what clothing would be suitable for the weather conditions.

To use the app, the user simply inputs their city and state, and the app will provide them with the weather forecast and clothing recommendation for the day. In order to retrieve the weather information, the app uses the longitude and latitude of the city, which is obtained by using a geocoding API.

The WeatherPrep app is a useful tool for anyone who wants to know what to wear based on the weather conditions. It provides a quick and easy way to get the daily weather forecast and clothing recommendation for the day.
